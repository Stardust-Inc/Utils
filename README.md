# Teleportation Utils
A collection of utility commands for your server, with emphasis on teleportation

## Setting up
Inside your terminal do
```
git clone https://github.com/Stardust-Inc/Utils.git
cp Help/target/Utils-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <path_to_your_server>/plugins
```
Now inside your Minecraft server run 
```
/reload
```
Inside of your `<path_to_your_server>/plugins` should now see a folder named `Utils` 
with a file inside named `config.yml` with a placeholder `spawn: 0 0 0`.
Inside this file, you can add other locations and use the command
```
/tport <name_of_location>
```
to go to other pre-defined locations
